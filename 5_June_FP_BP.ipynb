    "1. **Linear Transformation**: The forward propagation process starts with computing the weighted sum of inputs to each neuron, including the bias term. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n",
    "   \\[ z = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_i \\cdot x_i) + b \\]\n",

The activation function transforms the weighted sum into the output of the neuron. There are various activation functions commonly used in neural networks, each with its characteristics. Some popular activation functions include:\n",

    "   - **Leaky ReLU**: \\( \\sigma(z) = \\begin{cases} z, & \\text{if } z > 0 \\\\ \\alpha \\cdot z, & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a small constant (typically a small positive value).\n",

    "   - During forward propagation, the weighted sum of inputs is calculated by multiplying each input by its corresponding weight and summing them up.\n",
    "   - These weights are learned during the training process via techniques such as gradient descent, adjusting them to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs.\n",

    "   - Biases represent the offset term added to the weighted sum before passing it through the activation function.\n",
    "   - Biases allow neurons to have some flexibility in their activation thresholds, enabling them to fire even when all inputs are zero.\n",
    "   - Similar to weights, biases are learned during training to improve the model's ability to capture patterns in the data.\n",
